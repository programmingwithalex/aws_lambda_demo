## Description

This repo serves as a reference for the [YouTube playlist found here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvfoZq258gA&list=PLbn3jWIXv_ibGQml3zlXi1TfmdcIl6Afy&index=1).

This video will cover end-to-end how to:

* containerize a lambda function locally
* push the image to AWS manually
* push the image to AWS with CI/CD using GitHub Actions
* scheduling the lambda function to run as a recurring cron job
* building custom AWS EventBridge to automate creation of lambda function
* an update to the CI/CD GitHub Action that caches the Docker image on AWS ECR, speeding up run time
